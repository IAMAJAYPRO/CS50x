sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Time complexity found to be O(n*n) but it short-circuits on sorted arrays

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: When the input size increases by 10 times, the computation time only increases by about 5 times. For the other algorithms, it should have increased by 100 times.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Time complexity found to be O(n*n) but it doesn't short-circuits when encounter an already sorted array
